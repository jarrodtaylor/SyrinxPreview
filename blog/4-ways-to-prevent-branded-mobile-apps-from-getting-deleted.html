Brands must acquire the personnel, a platform and roadmap before they even begin on their mobile app development journeys. This is obviously pretty challenging for organizations that have never ventured into this arena before. That said, there are always opportunities to partner with experienced third-party firms to ensure that apps are created and released in a timely and efficient manner.</p><p>However, when it comes to getting consumers to use a mobile app, there isn&#39;t much help available. In fact, many brands have no idea how to guarantee that consumers download their app. More challenging than that, enterprises must inspire users to keep their mobile app installed. After all, deleting apps is second nature for consumers.</p><p><em>&quot;20% of users remove mobile apps from their devices after three months.&quot;</em></p><p>According to Computer Business Review Online, a 34SP survey of U.K. mobile users found that <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/news/mobility/apps/apps-miss-the-mark-on-consumer-expectations-4648325">20 percent of those individuals</a> remove mobile apps from their smartphones and tablets after three months. Additionally, The Drum reported on a study that discovered <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/02/27/84-consumers-have-deleted-branded-apps-after-only-one-use-finds-research-ampersand">84 percent of that same demographic</a> only use mobile apps once before uninstalling them. It&#39;s pretty clear that users are picky, hard to please and quick to react when it comes to mobile apps.</p><p>Here are four ways brands can prevent their mobile apps from getting deleted.</p><p><strong>1. Make it intuitive</strong><br>Apple introduced the world to mobile device simplicity and intuitiveness, and since then, that&#39;s all consumers want out of their mobile apps. Apadmi found that 56 percent of U.K. mobile users believe that branded apps <a href="https://www.apadmi.com/assets/uploads/2015/11/retail-app-report-november-2015.pdf">could function &quot;better,&quot;</a> while 43 percent indicated that they wished mobile payment apps were &quot;easier&quot; to use. Simply put, enterprises must listen to those individuals and deliver a mobile app that abandons frills and thrills, replacing them with clean user interfaces and simple ways to complete activities.</p><p>In an interview with Forbes, Suzanne Noble, founder and CEO of Frugl, recommended <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2015/12/01/what-you-need-to-know-to-create-a-successful-app-on-a-shoestring/">removing distractions</a> and making it easy to navigate menus as well as accomplish goals - such as buying an item or looking up product information.</p><p><strong>2. Launch glitch- and bug-free</strong><br>Brands are struggling to release mobile apps as fast as possible in hopes of striking the iron while it&#39;s hot with respect to the app craze, and this is actually hurting these enterprises in the long run. When companies rush to complete apps on a fixed schedule, bugs and glitches are often left behind in the code, and those issues inspire users to send apps to the recycle bin. According to a Dynatrace report cited by NBC News, 75 percent of consumers with mobile devices asserted that they delete retail apps <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/cyber-monday-trial-fire-many-retailers-websites-n471341">if they crash, have bugs or just under-perform</a>.</p><p>The solution here is simple, but not enough organizations engage with this best practice: Mobile app testing. Using cloud services or tools, mobile app developers can identify bugs, glitches and other issues while they develop, but most importantly, before they launch those apps.</p><p><img alt="Download Whitepaper" src="http://media.syrinx.com/media/06320ed4-4f81-4d18-8d4f-45d509c0f959/img/3340/14120080.jpg"></p><p><strong>3. Offer usefulness</strong><br>There are so many mobile apps on the market and available for free that brands need to differentiate themselves from others, while still retaining useful tools for completing transactions, looking up product information and generally interacting with their favorite companies. Computer Business Review Online noted that 39 percent of U.K. mobile users who deem an app as &quot;useless&quot; will drop it in the trash.</p><p>Brands also need to ensure that their app provides more than just a single functionality. According to Apadmi, 27 percent of U.K. consumers with mobile devices want to do more than simply look up products and buy them.</p><p>Mobile apps don&#39;t need to be unique snowflakes as much as they must be powerful tools for completing a few different activities. This way, there is always a task that consumers could use an app for. So, for mobile payment apps, this might mean providing users with the ability to do more than just pay - the app could allow customers to check balances, transfer funds and more. Meanwhile, a retail app should include some social features.</p><p><strong>4. Provide value, incentives or rewards</strong><br>The best way to keep users engaged and inspired to keep a mobile app is to provide actual value in the form of incentives and rewards. Apadmi explained that 34 percent of U.K. mobile device owners want apps to grant them special offers or at least allow them to accrue points in a loyalty program.</p><p>Therefore, retailers, banks and more should integrate existing rewards cards and promotional campaigns into their mobile apps. As a tip, brands should leverage mobile device notifications to frequently remind their users of discounts and offers. However, those features must work, so no organization should skimp on skilled developers and testers.</p><p>Getting consumers to keep a branded mobile app on their devices should be a high priority, and this is especially particular for companies in competitive sectors where offering an engaging app is a business differentiator.</p></article></main><div class="shim reversed"></div><aside><span class="h1">Have a project we can help with?</span> <a href="/contact">Talk To Us <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></aside><div class="shim"></div><footer><nav><a href="/services">Services</a> <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a> <a href="/company">Company</a> <a href="http://underserved.libsyn.com/">Podcast</a> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> <a href="/contact">Contact</a> <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></nav><p id="social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-facebook-official"></i></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrinxCo"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/SyrinxConsulting"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/syrinx-consulting-corporation"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p><p>Copyright &copy; &nbsp;<script type="text/javascript">document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>&nbsp; Syrinx.
