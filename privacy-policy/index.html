We build software that goes beyond a product and supports bigger business goals of creating scale and efficiencies. We build software for internal business needs, client-facing use-cases, supply chain, process flow, on any platform, and for every device.</p><p class="lead">In all we do we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p><h1>Privacy Statement</h1><p>Syrinx has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and personal information you provide or as you access and use materials on <a href="https://www.syrinx.com/">www.syrinx.com</a> (the "Site", "Website"), including the Site contact pages or other websites, or apps that post a link to this Privacy Statement. In addition, information that you submit to Syrinx in response to an email request for information or other outreach from Syrinx, or through our employment application processes, will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p><p>Syrinx may, at its discretion, amend this Privacy Statement from time to time. To ensure you can remain informed about the information we collect and how we use it, material changes to our statement will be reflected here. This Site may contain links to external sites which are not governed by this Privacy Statement. Syrinx does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of any third-party sites to which we link. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any such sites before you submit information there.</p><h1>Your Acceptance of This Privacy Statement</h1><p>Please read this Privacy Statement carefully. By browsing our Website and expressly consenting where required (for instance, when submitting your application), you agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement.</p><h1>Information About All Site Visitors</h1><p>In general, Syrinx gathers information about users of this Site collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently, the pages users access the most, and the links to our partners that users most often visit. Syrinx only uses such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most useful and beneficial for our users, and how we can continually improve the services and features provided to the users of our site. We may share this collected information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how our Site users, collectively, use this Site in order that they may create a better overall experience for you as well.</p><h1>Personal Information</h1><p>In some instances, such as when you sign up to use certain services, apply for a position, enter into a contest or promotion, or complete a survey for internal research, Syrinx may in the future ask for more specific information such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, skill sets and demographic information. Such information may be stored indefinitely and may be collected and processed in one or more databases maintained directly or indirectly by Syrinx. In addition to identification, registration and authentication, Syrinx may, with your consent as indicated by your checking 'Yes' on the profile form associated with any collection, use such information to contact you regarding potential employment opportunities, changes to and new offerings on our Site or to make you aware of additional products, services, specific events and promotions from Syrinx or its partners which may be of interest to you.</p><p>From time to time, Syrinx may also ask you for other information via surveys, such as information regarding your areas of interest, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, your career goals, services that you would like offered on this site, and other such information that will help us improve the service and features made available to you on this site. You may opt-out of receiving any further Internet-based communication from Syrinx or its partners by following the Choice/Opt-Out provided with each communication or by contacting us via the link below.</p><h1>Information Disclosure</h1><p>Syrinx will not knowingly disclose to any third party information about your individual visits to this Site or your name, address, e-mail address or your telephone number without your prior consent, except when we believe that the law requires such disclosure to a third party. Syrinx may record and share aggregated information with our partners.</p><h1>Resumes</h1><p>You have the option of submitting your resume to Syrinx. When you send your resume to Syrinx, your resume is entered into the Syrinx resume database and will be assigned to a Syrinx recruiter who may contact you as relevant employment opportunities arise. A recruiter will always speak to you about an opportunity before submitting your resume and will not submit a resume to a client without your prior consent. Syrinx uses its best efforts to grant access to your resume only to such third-party clients for whom you have given your consent. However, Syrinx is not responsible or liable if some other third party evades security measures and gains access to the resume database, and, subsequently, your resume. Syrinx's clients, to whom your resume has been sent with your consent, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in such instances.</p><h1>Retention of Your Personal Information</h1><p>Syrinx retains your personal information for so long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. We may retain your personal information for longer if they may be the subject of a legal claim or may otherwise be relevant for future litigation.</p><h1>Marketing</h1><p>If, at any time, you prefer not to receive further communications from us in any or all forms you will have the ability to unsubscribe from such communications by means of a link provided in every e-mail that is sent to you by us or by contacting us via the link below. When subscribing to Syrinx e-mail newsletters, you are given the opportunity to select which promotions, news, and information you would like to receive at the time of sign up, and you will have the opportunity to unsubscribe from such communications.</p><h1>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h1><p>Syrinx may use cookies on this Site and in our communications with you to keep track of your visit to our Site and our communications with you.
