<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>We invest our time by sitting down with you to discuss what problems you're encountering, what you want to accomplish, and whether we're a good fit for each other. We understand that there is a human aspect to process. From design mockups to layout, functionality, and look and feel we'll walk you through each step before coding anything. We'll also explain and map our designs and ideas to your objectives. Syrinx Consulting is a developer-founded, developer-run consulting company focused on the most efficient delivery of software engineering talent.</p>

<p>Syrinx's experienced developers are engaged in every step of the process, from the initial sales inquiry to the sourcing decisions. We take the time to understand your business and technical needs upfront, and work with senior resource managers to decide the right skill set for the job. We then send you exactly the right resources for the job, whether it's one developer or a whole team, saving you the time and hassle of interviewing, screening, and vetting technical resources. As a result, you get expertise and service tailored to your needs. Our clients trust us to deliver consistently high-quality talent, on-time and on-budget. We love what we do, and we do it well.</p>

      <h2>Enterprise Application Development</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>We like to simplify the complexity surrounding Enterprise Application Development by taking steps to securely integrate apps in real-time with the ability to transfer data between disparate systems, public and private clouds, and third-party technologies. With technology rapidly evolving, we help organizations limit technology constraints by applying standardized best practices that lower costs and improve ROI.</p>
    <p>We understand big problems and we respond by delivering lightweight, agile solutions. From cradle to scale to rewrite - at any development stage - we make software better.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Applications today are more connected and distributed than ever. It's not uncommon to have a handful of external connections per application in order to swap data or stay in sync with other systems around the globe. In order to help secure and manage these APIs, we work with many off-the-shelf and custom solutions. Our clients look to us for help in planning, developing, and implementing distributed solutions securely and seamlessly. We also bundle best in class testing to speed up and improve quality of both design and delivery.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The mobile payment market for goods and services, adopted globally, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

We build apps with instantaneous information exchange amongst devices and all relevant databases; with synchronization built into the very foundation of the apps; and as such our apps delight users with an intuitive, independent usability. Mobile payments and apps will revolutionize the way your business operates.</p>

And we understand that it's not just the technology that needs to function; it's integration, agility, scalability, inventory, marketing, and customer experience factors too.</p>

      <h2>Strategic Resourcing</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Strategic Resourcing, frequently referred to as Staff Augmentation, is our most agile and popular entry-level service. Sometimes you want specific skillsets you don't possess in-house; or you have to deliver on-time and on-budget a mission-critical short-term project. Syrinx stands out from the crowd with a pool of highly-vetted talent whom we retain on-staff, and are made available for on-site client engagments. Our consultants are amongst the top talent in the industry and the majority of our clients end up working with them for additional and on-going projects long after the initial scope.</p>
    <p>If you're looking to achieve faster development and speed-to-market, improved quality of development projects, and avoid costs associated with internal training and skill development, Syrinx's Strategic Resourcing will answer your call and exceed expectations.</p>
