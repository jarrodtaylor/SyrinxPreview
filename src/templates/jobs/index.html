<p>Many people that put javascript on their resumes, may have used it for some simple validation of form input, minor changes to pages such as putting in a jquery ui widget or a show/hide toggle. I'm looking for developers that have gone above and beyond that, and developed real applications. Individuals who have done this for the browser or they may have done this on the server side via nodejs. Experience applying coding patterns to their code (Module, Sandbox, etc), valued modularization, written unit tests, and optimized for performance. In other words, your experience using javascript as a first class coding language is exactly what they need. Other notables are advanced knowledge of javascript, including prototype-based inheritance, promises, event delegation, DOM queries, closures, callbacks, AJAX, JSON, and understand the JS memory model. Ideally, you'd have shown the ability to lead an effort, promote best practices, and help the rest of the team grow in their javascript ability.</p>
