# New App Changes the Way We Park: QuickPay

Barney Pell, the founder of the app states that ["the goal is to create a smarter approach to parking — and not just on the payment side."](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/quickpay-funding-barney-pell/) This app allows you to check for open parking spaces on your smart phone and you can pay for it on there as well. The wonderful thing about this app is that you don't need a smart phone to use it. You can pay or check for parking by calling the company and doing it over the phone.

When describing the app Pell says, "When a driver downloads the company’s mobile app, they can bring up a map showing parking lots that accept QuickPay payments. Then they can check out the current rates in those lots, reserve a space for a certain period of time, and pay within the app.When they arrive at the lot, instead of paying the attendant, they just show off their confirmation code"

This company is going to revolutionize the way we park in cities because it is going prevent people from driving an excess amount of time throughout the city looking for spots to park.

After securing $3.5 million dollars of funding so far this company seems to be on track for success.
