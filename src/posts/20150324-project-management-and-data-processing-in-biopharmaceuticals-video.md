# Biopharmaceuticals: Project Management & Data Processing

Transcript 

Biopharmaceutical firms tackle incredibly complex research and development on a daily basis. Naturally enough, that makes project management and data processing critical considerations for any company in this sector, with big data in particular playing a big role.

Now that big data's value is firmly established, though, having high-quality data processing is more important than ever in this field. As for project management, a lot of scientists resist manager over-reach or excessive control.
